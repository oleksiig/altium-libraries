## Custom Altium Footprints and Schematics libraries

**This repository does NOT contains any official Altium Libraries!**

Here collected my custom (generated **IPC compliant** or created manually) libraries for components which I've been used in misc electronics projects.

Most of the PCB footprints have 3D models.
